Movie Recommendation System

Project Overview:

This project builds a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens 10M dataset. The goal is to predict movie ratings for users and achieve a residual mean squared error (RMSE) of less than 0.86490. The project explores various modeling techniques, starting from a basic average rating model to more advanced methods incorporating movie, user, and year effects.

Key Features:

Data Exploration: Analyzes user and movie behavior patterns to identify trends and biases.

Model Development: Implements regularized regression models to capture movie, user, and year effects.

Evaluation: Achieves a final RMSE of 0.8645, meeting the project objective.

Future Improvements:

Potential enhancements include adding more features (e.g., genres, timestamps) and exploring advanced machine learning models.
